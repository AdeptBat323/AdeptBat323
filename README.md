# Hi, I'm Taariq ðŸ‘‹

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. ~ Arthur C. Clarke

I aspire to one day become a magician as described by Mr. Clarke. ðŸª„

## Things I have worked on:
### âˆ˜ THERMOCOUPLE CALIBRATION JIG ðŸ”©
A jig used to regulate fluctuating temperatures within a thermal chanber in order to assist with calibrating thermocouples of verious sizes, over a large temperature range (-150Â°C to 250Â°C). Project requested by Omnipless, COBHAM as part of student work.
### âˆ˜ ARDUINO THERMOCOUPLE DAQ ðŸ–¥
A data acquisition tool for reading K-type thermocouples. Using arduino nano, compatible analog-to-digital converters and data modelling software, the tool records data from a max of 16 sensors at a time and saves the data to a CSV file or sends live data straight into excel for easy visual representation. This DAQ used in conjunction with a calibration jig yields results within a 1.4Â°C variance.
### âˆ˜ RTD TEMPERATURE DAQ ðŸ–¥
A data acquisition tool for reading RTD temperature sensors using specific, compatible RTD amplifier boards. Initially project was set up for 2-wire interface with RTD as required by the company. however simple modification allows for 3- and 4-wire interface as well. The DAQ stores data to an SD card for independant use and is also able to send live data directly to an excel spreadsheet for visual representation. This DAQ used in conjuction with a calibration jig yields results within 0.2Â°C variance.
### âˆ˜ DIY BENCH PSU âš¡
Bench power supply built from standard desktop ATX PSU to provide 12V, 5V and 3.3V reliably while still providing overcurrent safety shutoff feature.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
### âˆ˜ HOME DIY 3D PRINTER ðŸ–¨
Custom RAMPS 1.6 3D printer built at home using aluminium extrusion framework and custom 3D printed parts. Project is based around Arduino Mega 2560, NEMA 17 stepper motors, Polulu DRV8825 stepper drivers and the RAMPS 1.6 printer shield for the arduino.
### âˆ˜ RASPBERRY PI MOBILE SETUP 
Linux-based mobile workstation developed to work on projects on the go. SD card can be interchanged for different usecases. Also converted to a media station at some point for camping. Custom power needs to be developed as the screen and raspberry pi run on different voltages and have different power requirements.

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- learning more in the field of embedded design
- learning in mechanical design
- developing programming skills
- improving problem solving abilities
